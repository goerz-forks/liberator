Priority list:
1-9 as in vim (9=required for next release, 5=would be nice, 1=probably not)

BUGS:
- add window resize support to hints
- can't reverse tab through the vimperator toolbar
- gu and gU doesn't work on Windows.
- searching backwards incrementally does not work i.e. with 'incsearch' set
- http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535258.aspx does not scroll with j/k/etc.
  same for http://forum.mootools.net/topic.php?id=3458
- insert abbreviations broken on <space>
- :sidebar improvements (:sidebar! Downloads while downloads is open should refocus the sidebar)
- http://www.maximonline.com/jokes/ - the prev and next buttons on the image map are not hinted
- ;f seems broken after a page load

FEATURES:
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 add more autocommands (BrowserStart, TabClose, TabOpen, TabChanged, LocationChanged, any more?)
8 ;?<hint> should show more information
8 all search commands should start searching from the top of the visible viewport 
8 :bdelete full_url<cr> and :bdelete! filter<cr> should delete all tabs matching filter or full_url
7 adaptive learning for tab-completions
  (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395739 could help)
7 use ctrl-n/p in insert mode for word completion
7 implement LocationList window, and get rid off/change PreviewWindow to be
  a real preview window being able to display html pages
7 [ctrl-o/i] to Go back to a Previous Position (done partly, however currenty does not use a per tab jumplist)
7 whereever possible: get rid of dialogs and ask console-like dialog questions
  or write error prompts directly on the webpage or with :echo()
7 [d could go to the last domain in the history stack. so if i browse from
  google to another page and click 10 links there, [d would take me back to the google page
  opera's fast forward does something like this
7 make an option to disable session saving by default when you close Firefox
6 :set [no]focuscontent
6 :set! browser.zoom.siteSpecific  by default?
6 jump to the next heading with ]h, next image ]i, previous textbox [t and so on
6 :grep support (needs location list)
6 use '' to jump between marks like vim
6 pipe selected text/link/website to an external command
6 :set wildoptions=auto mode, which would list completions on each keystroke (maybe performance problems)
6 Use ctrl-w+j/k/w to switch between sidebar, content, preview window
5 Favicons in completion windows and some other places?
5 make a command to search within google search results
  (http://gadelkareem.com/2007/01/28/using-google-ajax-api-as-an-array/)
  maybe impossible, needs a per-site key from google
4 y and Y could maybe changed to, but probably not: Y, yy and yl=yank location, ys=yank selection,
  yd=yank domain name, yt=yank title, yw=yank current word, yf=yank filename, (other things to yank?)
4 Add -nargs, -complete, etc. to :command
4 :set urlseparators=,\s+
4 } { should jump to the next paragraph of the page (maybe impossible)
3 Splitting Windows with [:sp :vsp ctrl-w,s ctrl-w,v] and closing with [ctrl-w,q], moving with [ctrl-w,w or tab]
  have a look into the split browser extension
- many other ideas are listed in the wiki

RANDOM IDEAS:
* numbered tabs
* hide scrollbars: (window.content.document.body.style.overflow = "hidden" has problems with the mouse wheel)
