Priority list:
1-9 as in vim (9=required for next release, 5=would be nice, 1=probably not)

BUGS:
- add window resize support to hints
- can't reverse tab through the vimperator toolbar
- gu and gU don't work on local files properly - still valid? Doesn't work on Windows.
- pvh option not working
- searching backwards incrementally does not work i.e. with 'incsearch' set

FEATURES:
9 :command for new commands
9 :map a :bmark<space> and A should toggle the "starred" (=bookmarked) state of the current url
8 add an interface for navigating document relationships including usage of
  the ] and [ keys to e.g. jump to the next heading ]], next image ]i, previous
  textbox [t and so on
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 autocommands (BrowserStart, BrowserQuit, TabClose, TabOpen, TabChanged, PreLocationChange, PageLoaded, any more?)
8 :sidebar improvements (:sidebar! Downloads while downloads is open should refocus the sidebar)
7 use ctrl-n/p in insert mode for word completion
7 implement LocationList window, and get rid off/change PreviewWindow to be a real preview window being able to display html pages
7 [ctrl-o/i] to Go back to a Previous Position (done partly, however currenty does not use a per tab jumplist)
7 whereever possible: get rid of dialogs and ask console-like dialog questions or write error prompts directly on the webpage or with :echo()
7 :set! should also set about:config options (with autocomplete)
6 :grep support (needs location list)
6 use '' to jump between marks like vim
6 pipe selected text/link/website to an external command
6 macros (qq, @q, ...)
6 gf = view source?
6 :set wildoptions=auto mode, which would list completions on each keystroke (maybe performance problems)
5 Use ctrl-w+j/k/w to switch between sidebar, content, preview window
5 Favicons in completion windows and some other places?
4 } { should jump to the next paragraph of the page (maybe impossible)
3 Splitting Windows with [:sp :vsp ctrl-w,s ctrl-w,v] and closing with [ctrl-w,q], moving with [ctrl-w,w or tab]
  have a look into the split browser extension
- many other ideas are listed in the wiki

RANDOM IDEAS:
* numbered tabs
* Would it be possible to add a setting "maxcompletionsshown" and 
  "maxpreviewwindowheight" or something like this?
* hide scrollbars: http://rafb.net/p/YHRhEe47.html (window.content.document.body.style.overflow = "hidden")
