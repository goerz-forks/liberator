Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

BUGS:
- SB doesn't support tab-undo yet so :undo and "u" etc don't work

FEATURES:
9 / and ? possibly reusing "Jump to" functionality directly.
8 Playlist/SmartPlaylist operations.
7 extended hint mode for opening links in FF.
5 Check for default extensions and add commands for them. Ex. Last.fm, Seeqpod e.t.c
