Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

BUGS:
- broken commands:
  - SB doesn't support tab-undo yet so :undo and "u" etc don't work
  - :tabduplicate
  - :back/H, :forward,L
  - :open songbird-internal-search searchString
    Is this workable anyway? --djk
  - <C-^> is off by one when alternating with the media tab
  - numbered tabs

FEATURES:
9 '?' - Reusing '/'. 
8 Playlist/SmartPlaylist operations & meta-data operations.
7 extended hint mode for opening links in FF.
5 Check for default extensions and add commands for them. Ex. Last.fm, Seeqpod e.t.c
    Wouldn't these be provided as Xulmus plugins like Vimperator does? --djk
