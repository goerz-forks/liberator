Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

BUGS:
- add window resize support to hints
- can't reverse tab through the vimperator toolbar
- searching backwards incrementally does not work i.e. with 'incsearch' set
- http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535258.aspx does not scroll with j/k/etc.
  same for http://forum.mootools.net/topic.php?id=3458 and
  http://kainhofer.com/~lilypond/Documentation/user/lilypond/
  probable problem:
  @media screen {
  body>div#tocframe {
    position: fixed
    }
  }

- insert abbreviations broken on <space>
- :sidebar improvements (:sidebar! Downloads while downloads is open should refocus the sidebar)
- http://www.maximonline.com/jokes/ - the prev and next buttons on the image map are not hinted
- ;s saves the page rather than the image
- :set! browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll=true -> clicking in the location bar unfocuses it immediately
- http://apcmag.com/why_os_x_106_snow_leopard_should_leave_powerpc_in_the_cold.htm - scrolls the wrong
  window with j/k (the green slashdot thing for me).
- http://cgiirc.blitzed.org?chan=%23debug is unusable after login in

(recent CVS regressions):
- A cached "awesomebar completion" result is still displayed, after the user removes "l" from the 'cpt' and
  no other matches are found
- "History" struct is very slow, causing massive problems/delays at startup. Adding 1000 History structs to an array
  takes about a second here, while adding the same amount of ['a', 'b'] arrays just takes 4ms. Probably all
  Structs are slow, as removing the "icon" -> favicon field didn't make it faster.
- start with an empty window with an about:blank tab only:
  :b a<tab>  changes the (Untitled) title to "about:blank"
- visual caret mode is broken
- Form elements in iframes must be selected twice, whether by tabbing or
  clicking.
- :runtime is broken, possibly Windows only
- :regressions is broken, also now blanks the MOW when run
- more prompt now reads "-- More --" at the end of multipage output when there is no more content

FEATURES:
9 adaptive timeout for auto-completions, :set completions can be updated more often than
  :open foo
9 :highlight clear and :colorscheme default
9 use the storage module for autocommands
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 all search commands should start searching from the top of the visible viewport
8 :addsearch wikpedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s  to allow saving of
  quick searches in the RC file.
7 adaptive learning for tab-completions
  (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395739 could help)
7 use ctrl-n/p in insert mode for word completion
7 implement QuickFix window based on ItemList
7 [ctrl-o/i] to Go back to a Previous Position (done partly, however currently does not use a per tab jumplist)
7 wherever possible: get rid of dialogs and ask console-like dialog questions
  or write error prompts directly on the webpage or with :echo()
7 [d could go to the last domain in the history stack. So if I browse from
  google to another page and click 10 links there, [d would take me back to the google page
  opera's fast forward does something like this
7 make an option to disable session saving by default when you close Firefox
7 The output of the pageinfo-command sould contain the security-information of ssl-encrypted sites
7 Add :every command
6 support private mode (and :set [no]private): http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2008-11-08/prepare-your-add-private-browsing
6 add [count] support to :b* and :tab* commands where missing
6 registers
6 allow for multiple ex commands separated with |
6 check/correct spellings in insert mode with some mappings
6 add more autocommands (TabClose, TabOpen, TabChanged, DownloadPre/Post any more?)
6 jump to the next heading with ]h, next image ]i, previous textbox [t and so on
6 :grep support (needs location list)
6 use '' to jump between marks like vim
6 pipe selected text/link/website to an external command
6 Use ctrl-w+j/k/w to switch between sidebar, content, preview window
6 Command :tags for getting a list of used tags
6 ;?<hint> should show more information
5 when looking at a zoomed out image (because it's large), zi should zoom in 
  maybe with this? : http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/content/html/document/public/nsIImageDocument.idl
5 make a command to search within google search results
  (http://gadelkareem.com/2007/01/28/using-google-ajax-api-as-an-array/)
  maybe impossible, needs a per-site key from google
4 y and Y could maybe changed to, but probably not: Y, yy and yl=yank location, ys=yank selection,
  yd=yank domain name, yt=yank title, yw=yank current word, yf=yank filename, (other things to yank?)
4 Add -nargs, -complete, etc. to :command
4 } { should jump to the next paragraph of the page (maybe impossible)
3 A format for 'guitablabel' and 'statusline' 
3 add a command-line window (:help cmdline-window in Vim). 
3 Splitting Windows with [:sp :vsp ctrl-w,s ctrl-w,v] and closing with [ctrl-w,q], moving with [ctrl-w,w or tab]
  have a look into the split browser extension
- many other ideas are listed in the wiki

RANDOM IDEAS:
* hide scrollbars: (window.content.document.body.style.overflow = "hidden" has problems with the mouse wheel)
