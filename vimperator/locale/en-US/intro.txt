*First there was a Navigator, then there was an Explorer.
Later it was time for a Konqueror. Now it's time for an Imperator, the
VIMperator :)*
+++</div>+++

section:Introduction[intro]

http://vimperator.org[Vimperator] is a free browser add-on for Firefox,
which makes it look and behave like the http://www.vim.org[Vim]
text editor. It has similar key bindings, and you could call it a modal
web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in.

|warning| +
Warning:
To provide the most authentic Vim experience, the Firefox menubar and toolbar
are hidden. +
If you really need them, type: [c]:set guioptions+=mT[c] to get them back. +
If you don't like Vimperator at all, you can uninstall it by typing
[c]:addons[c] and remove/disable it. +
If you like it but can't remember the shortcuts, then press [m]<F1>[m] or
[c]:help[c] to get this help window back.
