== Coding Style ==
In gerneral: Just look at other source code!
We try to be quite consistent, but of course, that's not always possible.

=== The most important style issues are: ===
* Use 4 spaces to indent things, no tabs, not 2, nor 8 spaces. If you use vim,
  this should be taken care of automatically by the modeline.

* Use " for enclosing strings instead of ', unless using ' avoids escaping of lots of "
  Example: alert("foo") instead of alert('foo');

* Exactly one space after if/for/while/etc. and after a comma, but none after a parenthesis
  or after a function call:
      for (pre, contition, post)
  but:
      alert("bla");

* Opening curly brackets { must be on a new line, unless it is used in a closure:
      myFunction ()
      {
          return;
      }
  but:
      setTimeout(function () {
          ...
      });
