*First there was a Navigator, then there was an Explorer.
Later it was time for a Konqueror. Now it's time for an Imperator, the
VIMperator :)*

section:Introduction[intro]

http://vimperator.mozdev.org[Vimperator] is a free browser add-on for Firefox,
which makes it look and behave like the http://www.vim.org[Vim]
text editor. It has similar key bindings, and you could call it a modal
web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in.

|warning| +
Warning: 
To provide the most authentic Vim experience, the Firefox menubar and toolbar were hidden. + 
If you really need them, type: [c]:set guioptions+=mT[c] to get them back. + 
If you don't like Vimperator at all, you can uninstall it by typing
[c]:addons[c] and remove/disable it. + 
If you like it, but can't remember the shortcuts, press [m]F1[m] or
[c]:help[c] to get this help window back.

Please send comments/bug reports/patches to the mailing list, where I will
properly answer any questions. You can also join the #vimperator IRC channel

can be improved when I find time for it or get patches.
