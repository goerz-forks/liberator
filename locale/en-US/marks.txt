Vimperator supports a number of different marks:

- Bookmarks which allow you to mark a web page as one of your favorites for
  easy access.
- QuickMarks allow you to define up to 62 (a-zA-Z0-9) web sites (or group of
  websites) which you really visit most often
- Local marks to store the position with a webpage
- History is also a special type of marks, as Vimperator automatically
  remembers sites which you have visited in the past.

The following options are interpreted:

- -title="custom title" (short option: -t)
- -tags=comma,separated,tag,list (short option: -T)
- -keyword=keyword (short option: -k)

If you don't add a custom title, either the title of the web page or the URL
is taken as the title. You can omit the optional [url] argument, so just do
:bmark to bookmark the currently loaded web page with a default title and
without any tags.
