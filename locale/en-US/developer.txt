section:Writing{nbsp}Documentation[writing-docs,documentation]

For every new feature, writing documentation is _mandatory_ for the patch to
be accepted. The docs are written in
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[asciidoc] version 8.x or
newer. The are placed in the _src/locale/en-US/_ directory and compiled with
_make doc_. Please refer to the asciidoc documentation above for details.
Usually you can just write text as is, and mostly it will be interpreted
correctly. The only difficult part is to write special sections like for
help::help[various.html#:help].


    |<F1>| |:help| |:h| |help|
    ||:h[elp] {subject}|| +
    ||<F1>||
    ____________________________________________________________________________
    Open help window. 
    The default section is shown unless {subject} is specified.
    If you need help for a specific topic, try [c]:help overview[c].
    ____________________________________________________________________________

Some notes about the code above:

- *$$|<F1>|$$* defines a _tag_. A tag is written at the right in magenta and let's
  you jump to a topic with [c]:help <F1>[c]. Note that you must write it from
  right to left, so in the above example $$|help|$$ will be the most left tag,
  and \|<F1>\| the most right one.
- *$$||:h[elp] {subject}|| +$$* and *$$||<F1>||$$* define command or mapping
  names and are printed on the left side. Note the + at the end of one
  command, that indicates a new line. There is no general rule when a new line
  is needed and when not, just try it out and see what looks better.
- The actual help code for this command is embedded in at least 4 underscores
  (_). This generates a quoteblock and indents the text so it is more clear
  that it belongs to the command.

There are also some additional asciidoc commands specifically for writing
vimperator documentation:

- *$$section:Writing{nbsp}Documentation[writing-docs,documentation]$$* Creates
  a new section like _Writing Documentation_ in this help file with 2 tags.
- *$$help:developer{nbsp}information[developer.html#documentation]$$* creates
  a link with text _developer information_ to the tag _documentation_ in
  the file _developer.html_.

If you don't know in which file/section you should put some documentation, ask
on the mailing list or on #vimperator. Usually help should be grouped together
in logically connected subject areas like
help:opening{nbsp}web{nbsp}pages[browsing.html#opening].
