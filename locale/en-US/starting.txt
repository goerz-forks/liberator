Vimperator does not yet read any command line options. When it does, they will
be documented here.

section:Initialization[initialization, startup]

At startup Vimperator sources a user RC file, containing Ex commands, and any
JavaScript files found in the plugin directory. The RC file may be named
[a].vimperatorrc_[a] or [a]\_vimperatorrc[a]. The search order is:

* Unix and Mac: [a]\~/.vimperatorrc[a] then [a]\~/_vimperatorrc[a]
* Windows - [a]\~/_vimperatorrc[a] then [a]\~/.vimperatorrc[a]

The plugin directory is named:

* Unix and Mac - [a]\~/.vimperator/plugin[a]
* Windows - [a]\~/vimperator/plugin[a]

The user's '$HOME'(~) directory is determined as follows:

* Unix and Mac - _$HOME_ is used.
* Windows - if _$HOME_ is set then this is used, otherwise _$USERPROFILE_ or finally
_$HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH_.

_$VIMPERATOR_HOME_ can be used to override the calculated _$HOME_ directory.
