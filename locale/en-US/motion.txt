This is the playground for testing asciidoc to make it finally
usable for our help system.

Abstract
--------
The optional abstract (one or more paragraphs) goes here.
You can also jump to xref:section[section].

This document is an AsciiDoc article skeleton containing briefly
annotated element placeholders plus a couple of example index entries
and footnotes. The preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and index
section titles are significant ('specialsections').

--------------------------------------
foo bar#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
        exit(0);
}
--------------------------------------

|scrollbind-relative| + 

Each 'scrollbind' window keeps track of its "relative offset," which can be
thought of as the difference between the current window's vertical scroll
position and the other window's vertical scroll position.  When one of the
'scrollbind' windows is asked to vertically scroll past the beginning or end
limit of its text, the window no longer scrolls, but remembers how far past
the limit it wishes to be.  The window keeps this information so that it can
maintain the same relative offset, regardless of its being asked to scroll
past its buffer's limits.

The First Section
-----------------
Article sections start at level 1 and can be nested up to four levels
deep.
footnote:[An example footnote.]
indexterm:[Example index entry]

And now for something completely different: ((monkeys)), lions and
tigers (Bengal and Siberian) using the alternative syntax index
entries.
(((Big cats,Lions)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Bengal Tiger)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Siberian Tiger)))
Note that multi-entry terms generate separate index entries.

Here are a couple of image examples: an image:images/smallnew.png[]
example inline image followed by an example block image:

.Tiger block image
image::images/tiger.png[Tiger image]

Followed by an example table:

.An example table
`-----------------`--------------------------
Option            Description
---------------------------------------------
-a 'USER GROUP'   Add 'USER' to 'GROUP'.
-R 'GROUP'        Disables access to 'GROUP'.
